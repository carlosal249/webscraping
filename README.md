<h1 align=center>Twitter scraper</h1>
*Note: today (31/07/2020) the library for tweet scraper is currently <b>deprecated</b> I  already contacted the creators of the library, they are fixing the error.

<h3>How to use? </h3>

```python
!pip install twitterscraper 
!pip install flask
#if you already have pandas ignore this!
!pip install pandas
```
<p> After you install the librarys all you need is download te templates folder and app.py file so create a folder and with cmd open the specific folder something like this 'C://user123//workspace//twitterscraper'</p>

<p> and with the cmd open, just type: </p>

```python
flask run app.py
```
<p>and it will open the local host in your default browser then just fill the places and donwload the tweets!</p>

<p> the main idea of the app is to collect tweets / interactions to check / validate with the marketing team which strategies work best with our audience, and subsequently perform a sentiment analysis on the extracted texts
